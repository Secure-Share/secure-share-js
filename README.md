# Secure Share JavaScript Library

This repository contains the JavaScript library used for client side encryption in Secure Share, which is based on [Firefox Send](https://github.com/mozilla/send). The library utilizes HTTP Encrypted Content-Encoding scheme ([RFC8188](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8188)) for file encryption.
